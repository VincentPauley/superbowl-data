# Superbowl Data

This is a very simple express server written in typescript that returns
some data on superbowl wins/losses by team. Use it to practice algorithms
and sorting or create some interesting UI representations of the data. Some
ideas possible with the data are:

- Total wins
- Total Appearances
- Win Percentage
- Appearance map (darker for wins, medium for appearances, nothing for missing year)
- Repeats (wins/losses)
- longest droughts appearances
- longest droughts wins
- fastest recovery (loss to win)

**_Note_**

Superbowls are generally played in February, but the NFL season takes place in the fall/winter of
the year prior. In this data set the superbowl wins/losses are represented by the year of the season, this is generally how people refer to superbowl titles. For example the Chicago Bears won
a superbowl that was played in February of 1986, to award a champion of the 1985 season. For this
reason the superbowl champion Bears are referred to as the '85 Bears, and in this data their win is
represented as 1985.
